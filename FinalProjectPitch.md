## Site Name:

Still trying to decide between **_Electric Waves_** or **_Tapeless Studio._** Leaning towards **_Electric Waves_**.

## Who is the site for?

The sites content will primarily be directed towards novice recordists but will also contain information for advanced engineers.

## What problem am I solving?

Learning to mix music on a professional level is a tedious and arduous journey. Without direction, it can take years to fumble your way through bad practices to get to the good ones and I would like to help speed up that process.

## How am I going to solve this problem?

Drawing from my personal experiences and of those around me- particularly the not so great experiences that led to the development of bad habits- I intend to provide access to appropriate video tutorials, articles and software reviews that will hopefully help steer new recordists in the right direction.

## Why is my solution going to work?

This will work because this is a very popular field and people turn to the internet for information. I will provide a clear and concise site for those people to find answers- from someone who has been through the same process.
