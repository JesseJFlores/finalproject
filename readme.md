# FINAL PROJECT

## Elevator Pitch

I would like to build a site that brings together video tutorials along with blogs/articles about audio production.

## The 5 W's

This site will be for aspiring, novice recordists and advanced engineers. It will contain a mixture of tutorial videos, articles, charts, gear reviews, etc. I have been through the incredibly lengthy and confusing process of learning how to record, mix and master, and it is quite daunting. I'd like to help speed up the process for others by sharing my experiences, trials and tribulations.

## SITE MAP

1. HOME PAGE   
1. TUTORIALS  
1. ARTICLES  
1. GEAR

## LIBRARIES/SPECIAL FEATURES

* Google Fonts/Type Kit
* Bootstrap or Bourbon and Neat
* Font Awesome or Material Design
* jQuery or CSS Animation
