# FINAL PROJECT

## Elevator Pitch

I would like to build a site that brings together video tutorials along with blogs/articles about audio production.

## The 5 W's

Who: This site will be for aspiring, novice recordists on up to advanced engineers.

What: Mixture of tutorial videos, articles, charts, etc.

Where: On your desktop, laptop or mobile device.

When: All the time, or as needed.

Why: I have been through the incredibly lengthy and confusing process of learning how to record, mix and master and it is quite daunting. I'd like to help speed up the process for others by sharing my experiences, trials and tribulations.
