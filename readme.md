# FINAL PROJECT

## Elevator Pitch

I would like to build a site that brings together video tutorials along with blogs/articles about audio production.

## The 5 W's

This site will be for aspiring, novice recordists as well as advanced engineers. I have been through the incredibly lengthy and confusing process of learning how to record, mix and master, and it is quite daunting. I'd like to help speed up the process for others by sharing my experiences, trials and tribulations.

## BASIC FEATURES/CONTENT

* video tutorials  
* reference articles  
* blog (my own two cents)
* gear reviews
* info graphics/charts

## SITE MAP

1. HOME PAGE   
1. VIDEOS    
1. PLUG INS
1. RESOURCES

## LIBRARIES/SPECIAL FEATURES

* Google Fonts/Type Kit
* Bootstrap or Bourbon and Neat, or possibly just Flexbox
* Font Awesome or Material Design
* jQuery or CSS Animation

## MVP

At the very least I will need branding that includes a logo (icon and typographical), a color scheme and a body font plus header font. There will need to be a HOME page, a VIDEOS page, a PLUG-IN page and a RESOURCES page. The home page will feature one of the latest additions to each category- a video, one plug-in review, and a side bar containing links/pics to external resources- this way the user can immediately engage with the content upon initially viewing the site. The user can then select a link from the navigation to further view more specific content- i.e., tutorials, featured plug-ins, and a list of all resources for learning (links to external sites or articles). The site will need to be responsive so it can properly be viewed from any device.

## USER STORIES

1. Wants to watch a video to learn about mixing techniques using the latest version of Pro Tools.  
1. Visits site and would like to read a review about a new Plug-In to find out if it is worth buying/renting.
1. Just browsing the site and happens to click on one of the "resources" links in the side bar to an external site.
